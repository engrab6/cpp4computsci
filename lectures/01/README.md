# The misunderstood monster

- Large: the C++11 standard is about 1300 pages

- Composed of many parts: C, classes, generics, functional
  programming, exceptions, the vast library, ...

- Inspires dread in those do not understand it

- Dangerous:

But you can cut off some extra legs to get the right dog for your
program!

# The philosophy of C++

-   General purpose

-   Flexible by allowing developers to build abstractions (and provides
    a large number through the library)

-   Performance and efficiency always targeted "You only pay for what
    you use"

-   Use the powerful type system to express intent.

# These few lectures

We could spend all semester going in depth on C++,
but we've got three lectures plus a "drop in".

So I've picked a handful of features to cover today that you really need
to write C++ for HPC:

-   References and memory

-   Overloading

-   Classes

-   Templates

---
template: titleslide
#But first\...

---
name: hello
# Hello!

```C++
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
}
```

---

template: hello

```
$ g++ --std=c++11 hello.cpp -o hello
$ ./hello 
Hello, world!
```
---

template: hello

Include the `iostream` standard library header which gives us a way to
communicate with the file system


---
template: hello

`std` is the standard library namespace.

A namespace allows scoping of names (much like a filesystem has
directories).

The scope resolution operator `::` lets us access a declaration from
inside a namespace.

---
template: hello

`cout` represents console output (i.e. stdout)

---

template: hello

The standard library uses the bitwise left shift operator (`<<`) to mean
stream insertion

I.e. output the right hand side to the left.

(Similarly, the right shift (`>>`) operator is used for extraction, i.e.
input.)

---
template: titleslide

# Memory and references
---

# Don't use malloc again

While you can use `malloc` and `free` in C++, you should not.

Instead, if you need to directly allocate memory use `new` and
`delete`.

```C++
int* x = nullptr;
x = new int;
*x = 42;

std::cout << "The answer is "<< *x <<std::endl;
// The answer is 42

delete x;
```
---

# Slightly different for arrays

```C++
int* squares = nullptr;
squares = new int[5];
for (auto i=0; i<5; ++i) {
  squares[i] = i*i;
}

// Do something

delete[] squares;
```
Note the square brackets!

---

# References

As well as pointers and values, C++ has the concept of a *reference*.

They are like pointers in that they don't copy the
thing-that-is-referred-to, but syntactically they are just like a
value.

```C++
double pi = 3.14;
double& pr = pi;
std::cout << pr << std::endl;

void iLoveIntegers(double& x) {
x = 3;
}

iLoveIntegers(pi);

\\ prints 3
std::cout << pi << std::endl;
```

---

# References: whys and whens

References have simpler syntax.

References are safer than pointers: a reference cannot be null and
cannot be reseated (must be bound when it's defined)

```C++
double twopi = 6.24;
pr = twopi; \\ Error will not compile
```

And you can rely on it being valid, unless there is an evil coder
around:
```C++
char& get() {
  char x = '!';
  return x;
  // Many compilers will warn about this
}
```

Use a reference by default, until you need a pointer. (E.g. need to
reseat or interface with C.)

---

template: titleslide
# Overloading
---

# Function overloading
You can have multiple functions with the **same
name** but **different arguments**.
```C++
int sum(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
double sum(double a, double b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

When you call `sum`, the compiler knows the types of the arguments and
will try to find the best match from all the candidates with the name.

The compiler will also try to use any built-in or user-defined
conversion rules.

---

# What happens here?
```C++
int i1 = 1;
int i2 = 2;
double d1 = 1.0;
double d2 = 2.0;
unsigned u42 = 42;

std::cout << sum(i1, i2) << std::endl;
std::cout << sum(3, 72) << std::endl;
std::cout << sum(i1, u42) << std::endl;
std::cout << sum(d2, d1) << std::endl;
std::cout << sum(d2, i1) << std::endl;
std::cout << sum(d2, 1.0f) << std::endl;
```
---

# Operators are functions

C++ operators, for the non-built in types, are just functions with odd
names, e.g.:
```C++
Vector operator+(const Vector& a, const Vector& b);
```

You can then use the natural syntax when manipulating these in other
code:

```C++
Vector c = a + b;
```

We'll come back to this.

# Classes
---

# Objects in C++

You define a class just like a `struct`, but using the keyword `class`
instead.[^1]

As well as *data members*, instantiations of classes (i.e. objects) can
have *member functions*.

```C++
class Complex {
    public:
      Complex();
      Complex(float re, float im);
      Complex(const Complex&) = default;
      float magnitude() const;
    private:
      float real;
      float imag;
};
```
---
# Creating complexes
When you create an instance of your class, you
usually need to provide a *constructor*.

Note we provide two overloads - a default one needing no arguments and
one that initialises with a value.

We also tell the compiler to create a *default copy constructor* for us.

```C++
Complex::Complex() : real(0), imag(0) {
}

Complex::Complex(float re, float im) : real(re), imag(im) {
}

// This is roughly what the compiler will create
// Complex::Complex(const Complex& c) :
//   real(c.real), imag(c.imag) {
// }
```
---
#Creating complexes
We can now create these numbers
```C++
Complex zero;
Complex imaginary_unit(0, 1);
Complex copy_of_i(imaginary_unit);
```

What about actually doing something?

---

# Using complexes

```C++
float Complex::magnitude() const {
  return sqrt(real*real + imag*imag);
}
```

-   The `const` at the end of the declaration says that this function
    will not alter the instance it is working on. Add this whenever
    possible!

-   We can access the members by just giving their names.

-   The instance that the function is working on is also available as a
    pointer, called `this`, so could rewrite as:

```C++
float Complex::magnitude() const {
return sqrt(this->real*this->real + this->imag*this->imag);
}
```
---

# Using complexes

Complex numbers have the usual arithmetic operations: ($+-\times\div$)

We have to provide operator overloads, like:

```C++
Complex operator+(const Complex& a, const Complex& b) {
  return Complex{a.real+b.real, a.imag+b.imag};
}
```

This is just a function (with an unusual name) that takes two complex
numbers and returns one.

To let this function touch the private members of the class, we must
declare that it is a `friend`:

```C++
    class Complex {
      // ...
      friend Complex operator+(const Complex&, const Complex&);
};
```

# Templates

# Templates 101

Templates are a method of doing *metaprogramming*: a
program that writes a program.

An easy example:

```C++
int sum(int a, int b) {
  return a+b;
}
double sum(double a, double b) {
  return a+b;
}
```

What if we need this for `float` and `unsigned`?

Going to get boring and hard to maintain quickly!

---
# Templates 101

```C++
template<typename T>
T sum(T a, T b) {
  return a+b;
}
```

When you use it later, the compiler will substitute the types you supply
for `T` and then try to compile the template.

```C++
cout <<"add unsigned=" << sum(1U, 4U) << endl;
cout <<"add floats=" << sum(1.0f, 4e-2f) << endl;
```

---

# Template classes

You can define a template class - i.e. a template that will produce a
class when you instatiate it.

Let's build something useful, like a simple array class.

```C++
template<class T>
class Array {
  unsigned _size;
  T* _data;
public:
  Array();
  Array(unsigned n);
  ~Array();
  unsigned size() const;
  const T& operator[](unsigned i) const;
  T& operator[](unsigned i);
};
```

---

# Where to put your implementation?

Templates are *not* executable code - they tell the compiler how to
create it.

So the definition must be available to the user of your template -
i.e. typically in a header file.

You can define the functions in place like:

```C++
template<class T>
class Array {
public:
  Array() : _size(0), _data(nullptr) {}
};
```

Or at the end of the header (or equivalently in another file that you
include at the end of your header)

```C++
template<class T>
Array<T>::Array(unsigned n) : _size(n) {
  _data = new T[n];
}
```
---
# How to release that memory?

We have acquired some memory in the constructor and at the moment we
will leak this.

Typically a class's *destructor* will do this.

The name of this function is `~Array`

```C++
template<class T>
Array<T>::~Array() {
  delete[] _data;
}
```

It's important to note that you should **never call this directly** -
the compiler will call it for you when your `Array` objects:

-   go out of scope (i.e. local variables)

-   are `delete`d

-   belong to another object and that object is destructed

---

#RAII / CADRe

A very important pattern in C++ is **RAII**: resource allocation is
instantiation. Also known as constructor acquires, destructor
releases.

This odd name is trying to communicate that any resource you have (heap
memory in this case) should be tied to the lifetime of an object.

So the when the compiler destroys your object it will release the
resource (e.g. memory).

```C++
void do_simulation(Parameters& p) {
  Array<float> work_array(p.problem_size);
  initial_condition(work_array);
  for(int i=0; i<p.timesteps; ++i) {
    do_timestep(work_array);
  }
  write_output(p.outfile, work_array);
}
```
---

# Copying

One thing we've not discussed about this array is what do we want to
do about copying?

-   We could create a shallow copy, using a simple pointer copy, but
    then which instance owns the data?

-   We could instead do a deep copy of the data each time, but that
    might be expensive. Maybe we want to disallow implicit copying but
    allow a user to explicitly copy with a special `copy()` method?

These design decisions should be considered!

---

# Returning an Array

What happens if we compute an array in a function and return it?
```C++

Array<int> load(const string& fn) {
  auto n = getsize(fn);

  Array<int> ans(n);
  for (auto i=0; i<n; ++i)
    ans[i] = read(fn, i);
  return ans;
}

void user() {

  auto data = load(fn);

}
```
---
# Returning an Array

People assume this is what happens:

```C++

Array<int> load(const string& fn) {
  auto n = getsize(fn);

  Array<int> ans(n); // allocate
  for (auto i=0; i<n; ++i)
    ans[i] = read(fn, i);
  return ans; // copy to a temporary
}

void user() {
  // Call default c'tor
  auto data = load(fn); // copy tmp->data
                        // destroy tmp
}
```
---
# Returning an Array

So they try alternatives, e.g return a pointer:

```C++

Array<int>* load(const string& fn) {
  auto n = getsize(fn);
  // OMG - new!
  auto ans = new Array<int>(n); //allocate twice
  for (auto i=0; i<n; ++i)
    (*ans)[i] = read(fn, i); // UGLY!
  return ans;
}

void user() {

  auto data = load(fn);
 // Better remember to delete this!
}
```
---

# Returning an Array

Or pass an output argument by reference
```C++

void load(const string& fn, Array<int>& ans) {
  auto n = getsize(fn);

  ans.resize(n); // probably allocate
  for (auto i=0; i<n; ++i)
    ans[i] = read(fn, i);
  // no return :)
}

void user() {
  Array<int> data; // Have to declare :(
  load(fn, data); // No copy :)
  // Regressing to assembly :(
}
```
---

# Returning an Array
How about not copying - move intead

Need to define a new *move* constructor and assignment
```C+++
template<class T>
class Array {
public:
  Array(Array&& other) :
    _size(other._size), _data(other._data) {
    other._data = nullptr;
    other._size = 0;
  }
};
```

The double ampersand indicates an "r-value reference".\

The compiler will only use this when the argument is a temporary value
that is going to be destructed - you can safely steal its resources.
---

# Returning an Array
How about not copying - move intead

```C++

Array<int> load(const string& fn) {
  auto n = getsize(fn);

  Array<int> ans(n); // Construct
  for (auto i=0; i<n; ++i)
    ans[i] = read(fn, i);
  return ans; // This moves to the temporary
}

void user() {

  Array<int> data = load(fn); // temporary moved to data
                              // temporary destructed
}
```
---

# Returning an Array

Compilers are allowed to do *copy elision* 

```C++
// Compiler adds secret arg 
Array<int> load(const string& fn) {
  auto n = getsize(fn);

  Array<int> ans(n); // Alias ans to secret
  for (auto i=0; i<n; ++i)
    ans[i] = read(fn, i);
  return ans; // No-op
}

void user() {
  // Create empty space for data
  Array<int> data = load(fn); // pass data as secret arg          
}
```

Compilers can do this even when this may have
side effects!

They directly construct the return value in its destination

In C++17 this is **required**

# Practical

The practical will have you rewriting a simple linked-list example
with C++ and improving this Array template.

You will then try using the STL: the standard template library
instead.
