# Modern C++ for Computational Scientists

Since the 2011 revision to the C++ language and standard library, the
ways it is now being used are quite different. Used well, these
features enable the programmer to write elegant, reusable and portable
code that runs efficiently on a variety of architectures.

However it is still a very large and complex tool. This set of online
lectures, delivered over two Wednesday afternoons and including
practical exercises, will cover a minimal set of features to allow an
experienced non-C++ programmer to get to grips with language. These
include: overloading, templates, containers, iterators, lambdas and
standard algorithms. It concludes with a brief discussion of modern
frameworks for portable parallel performance which are commonly
implemented in C++.

The course would appeal to existing C++ programmers wanting to learn
techniques that are applicable to numerical computing, or C
programmers who want to know what parts of the C++ standard they
should prioritise when learning new features.

These lectures were delivered as part of [EPCC](http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk)'s MSc in High Performance Computing in 2017 and an [ARCHER virtual webinar](https://www.archer.ac.uk/training/virtual/) in 2018.
