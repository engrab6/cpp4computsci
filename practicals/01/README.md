## A linked list class

### C recap

Check that you understand the exercise we started in the lecture on C.
An example solution is on the Learn messageboard for the course.

### Reimplement this as a class

The goal of this is to implement a very similar linked-list as a C++
class.

In `cpp4computsci/practicals/01/1-list` there is a Makefile, a test
program, a header file containing the class definition, and a partial
implementation in `list.cpp`. Running `make` will try to build the
executable `test`. This program generates some random numbers and adds
them to an instance of your list class, keeping them sorted.

When complete your program will produce output like:

```bash
$ ./test 100
Time to insert 100 integers = 0.000142364 s
Were correctly ordered
$ ./exA 1000
Time to insert 1000 integers = 0.0025844 s
Were correctly ordered
```

You need to edit `list.cpp` and complete the code. The design I have
used is very similar to the C implementation and is *not* idiomatic C++.
If you can see improvements - go ahead and try them - but note we will
come back to this.

When you have this working, try to answer the following

1.  How does it scale as you increase $N$? Try plotting on a log-log
    scale. Is this what you expected? You may wish to `make clean` and
    recompile with higher optimisation (add `-O3` to the `CXXFLAGS`
    variable in the Makefile).

2.  Point out a few flaws in this design. Things to consider include:
    const-correctness, RAII, having to use a non-standard iteration
    syntax.

## Array

The array is a fundamental data structure, especially for processing
large amounts of data, as it allows the system to take advantage of the
cache hierarchy.

Recall the array template examples from the lecture - in
`cpp4computsci/practicals/01/2-array` is a basic implementation and a
(hopefully) working test program, very similar to the previous one.

Compile this and run it for a few problem sizes. What is the scaling?
How does this compare to the linked list?

We need to take a decision about copying - do we wish to allow implicit
copying which for large arrays is very slow? If not, should we add an
*explicit* method to do this? What would its signature be? How would we
tell the compiler not to allow this?

## Libraries

### Memory

While we've taken a RAII approach here, it comes with some overhead: we
had to implement (or delete) five functions: the destructor, the copy
constructor, the move constructor, the copy assignment operator, and the
move assignment operator. This concept is known as "the rule of five"
(before C++11 it only had three).

A more idiomatic approach is to wrap the resource into a class that does
nothing but manage a resource, then it can be used elsewhere and the
compiler will produce correct implicit constructors, destructor and
assignment operators with no boilerplate code!

See one of the below for an in-depth discussion:
- http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/rule_of_three
- http://scottmeyers.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/a-concern-about-rule-of-zero.html

Fortunately the standard library includes several "smart pointers" that
will do this for you for memory! They can be accessed using the
`<memory>` header.

They are:

-   `std::unique_ptr` - this uniquely owns the pointed-to object. The
    object is deleted (can be customised) when the smart pointer
    destructs or you assign a new value. You cannot copy a `unique_ptr`.
    *This should be your default pointer type!*

-   `std::shared_ptr` - this shares ownership of the pointed-to object.
    All the child `shared_ptr`s point to the same object. The object
    will be deleted when *all* the pointers are either destructed or
    assigned a new value.

-   `std::weak_ptr` - much like a `shared_ptr` but it doesn't own a
    share of the object. It can become invalid. Used to break reference
    cycles.

(There also exists a `std::auto_ptr`. This is deprecated and has been
removed from C++17, so do not use it.)

Have a look at the [reference](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory)
and re-implement `Array` using either a unique or shared pointer.

### Containers

The standard library also has a number of containers for objects. These
include a list template class (typically a doubly-linked list) and a
vector which is a contiguous dynamically sized array a bit like our
`Array<T>`. There are also hash tables, queues (single and double
ended), stacks, etc.

The full list is here http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container.

Replace your list with `std::list<int>` and compare performance.

Try the same with replacing your array with `std::vector`.
